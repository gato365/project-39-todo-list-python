# Python To-Do List Application: Classroom Integration Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the interactive learning module designed to introduce your students to basic programming concepts through a practical, hands-on Python project. This README accompanies a simple To-Do List application developed in Python, offering a fantastic opportunity to engage students with real-world coding practices. By integrating this project into your curriculum, students will explore fundamental programming structures such as functions, loops, conditionals, and basic data handling.

## Objectives
- **Introduce Basic Programming Concepts**: Students will learn about variables, control flow (if-else statements), loops (while), and functions.
- **Develop Problem-Solving Skills**: Enhance logical thinking as students work through adding, deleting, and viewing tasks within the application.
- **Encourage Practical Coding Experience**: Provide students with firsthand coding experience, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application.

## Classroom Implementation

### Before the Lesson
- **Prepare**: Familiarize yourself with the Python script and its functionalities. Ensure Python is installed on classroom computers or devices.
- **Customize**: Consider modifying the script to better suit your classroom needs or to add additional challenges for your students.

### During the Lesson
1. **Introduction**: Start with an overview of what the application does and a brief discussion on why learning to code is important.
2. **Watch the Video**: Play the instructional video that walks through the code. Pause at intervals to discuss key points and answer any questions.
3. **Code Along**: Have students follow along with the video, typing out the code in their own Python environment. Encourage them to type rather than copy-paste for a better learning experience.
4. **Interactive Q&A**: After completing the application, hold a Q&A session to address any uncertainties or curiosities students might have about the project or Python in general.

### After the Lesson
- **Assign Challenges**: Encourage students to modify the application, perhaps by adding new features or improving existing ones.
- **Peer Review**: Organize a session where students review each otherâ€™s code, providing feedback and suggestions.
- **Reflect**: Have students write a brief reflection on what they learned and how they might use these skills in the future.
